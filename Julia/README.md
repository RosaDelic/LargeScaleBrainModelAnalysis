# Julia codes

1. HomogenousSystem.jl: Homogeneous system describing the dynamics on the homogeneous invariant manifold of the network

2. Network.jl: Large-scale brain model, where each node is an E-I network that we model with next generation neural mass models.

3. NormalizedMatrix.npz: Npz file containing the normalized structural connectivity matrix.

All the .pynb files are notebooks containing simulations of the models and computing the Lyapunov exponents or the Fourier Transform.
