2. c.ngsyn: C file containing initialization and default parameters for AUTO.

3. BifDiagram1DIexte.auto.py: Auto file to perform the 1D bifurcation diagram of the homogeneous system with respect to the $I_ext^E$ parameter.

4. BifDiagram2DPar2.auto.py: Auto file to perform the 2D bifurcation diagram of the homogeneous system with respect to the $(I_ext^E,\varepsilon)$ parameters.

5. PeriodDoublingStudy.py: Auto file to perform the 2D bifurcation diagram of the homogeneous system with respect to the $(I_ext^E,\varepsilon)$ parameters only in the region enclosed by the period doubling bifurcations.
